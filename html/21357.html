<p>Even in the most difficult times, we have seen people <strong>rising up to the challenge with kindness:</strong> Teachers looking out for their students. Communities coming together like never before. Donors giving out of their hearts to ensure that the most vulnerable are not left behind.</p>
<p>UNHCR’s life-saving work is made possible largely because of the commitment and generosity of individual donors. <strong>These are their stories.</strong></p>

<p>Seven years after Gene Patrick Losa first came across a UNHCR booth at a mall in 2017, he remains steadfast in his goal of helping the vulnerable get back on their feet. To him, the feeling he gets from knowing he has made a direct impact on people’s lives is second to none. </p>
<p>Though Gene had heard about UNHCR from the news before, he was moved to make his first monthly donation upon finding out that UNHCR’s assistance comes when people forced to flee need it the most, helping them rebuild their lives. He found solace in this, sharing that “For me, this is the right way to help – <b>Helping without robbing them of dignity by making them dependent</b>, and there is hope to get back”. </p>
<p>In the last seven years of sharing his blessings, Gene has helped countless individuals and families get back on their feet after experiencing events out of their control. Showing us how far a little act of kindness can reach, he expressed that <b>“I hope that displaced families will be able to get on their feet again, live normal lives again, and in their own little ways can pay it forward to those in need in the future.”</b> </p>
<p>To him, UNHCR’s work then becomes even more crucial as he believes that refugees and displaced families are often overlooked in news and social media. Committed to the cause, he continues to stand with refugees through involving his family and friends. Though he does not personally know the people his monthly donations crucially aid, the thought of some being able to live peaceful lives and help other refugees fills him with hope. </p>
