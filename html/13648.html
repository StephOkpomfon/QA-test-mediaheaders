<b>BACKGROUND</b><br />
Over the last two years globally, UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, has rolled out the <b>#WithRefugees</b> campaign to build solidarity for refugees and forcibly displaced families—some of the most vulnerable people of our time. In the Philippines, UNHCR has culminated the campaign every year on June 20, World Refugee Day. <br />
This 2018, UNHCR commemorated World Refugee Day with <b><i>Liwanag ng Marawi</i></b>, a photo exhibit that aimed to build stronger solidarity for families who were forced to leave everything behind because of the conflict. <br />
UNHCR Philippines opened <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/ph/liwanag-ng-marawi-call-for-submission">a call for submissions from 23 May to 8 June 2018</a>. Persons displaced by the conflict were invited to send photos they took during and after the conflict, as well as the ensuing displacement.<br />
The selected entries were featured on 19 June 2018 to mark the week-long commemoration of World Refugee Day. The chosen photos were on display from 19 to 22 June 2018 in Iligan City.<br />
Together <strong>#WithRefugees</strong>, UNHCR Philippines amplifies the voices and empowers families and communities forced to flee their homes.<br />
