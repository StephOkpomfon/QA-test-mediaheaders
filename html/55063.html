<strong>The Initiative for Promoting Digital Birth Registration In Bangsamoro Autonomous Region In Muslim Mindanao - Programming Services</strong><br />
<strong>Published on:</strong> 04 October 2024<br />
<strong>Deadline:</strong> 18 October 2024 23:59 Philippines time<br />
The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) was established on<br />
December 14, 1950, by the United Nations General Assembly. The agency is mandated to lead and<br />
co-ordinate international action to protect refugees and resolve refugee problems worldwide. Its<br />
primary purpose is to safeguard the rights and well-being of refugees. It also has a mandate to help<br />
stateless people.<br />
To address these issues, UNHCR is initiating a project to support birth registration within the two<br />
population groups along with decommissioned combatants and their families to facilitate access to<br />
documentation to establish legal identity and contribute to sustainable solutions to end statelessness.<br />
As part of this initiative, UNHCR will provide support to the digitization process of 50 local civil<br />
registrars in BARMM with the objective of strengthening their intake and data management<br />
capacities. This will be done through the provision of equipment and establishment of an archiving,<br />
indexing, and recording system which reduces manual records processing. This will later allow ease<br />
in integration with the civil registry digitalization efforts of the Philippine Statistics Authority<br />
through its PhilCRRIS once it is fully rolled-out.<br />
