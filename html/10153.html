<h2>Get Involved</h2><p>We are experiencing the worst humanitarian crisis since World War II. There are many ways you can get involved and support our work. </p></header>
    
<p>
We work around the clock to protect and assist refugees all over the world. But we need your help to continue.</p>
<p>There are many ways you can help UNHCR. One is to make a donation, which will go straight towards our worldwide field operations. It's an easy process and you can give however much you want – everything helps.</p>
<p>Another way to help is to raise awareness, joining us on our social networks or helping to fundraise in your local communities.</p>
<p>We also welcome interns and UN volunteers at our headquarters and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Support UNHCR today.</p>
