The UN refugee agency representative in Pakistan, Mr. Indrika Ratwatte inaugurated the new school block with government officials, refugee elders and nine teachers. “Ms. Aqeela Asifi’s dedication to promote education for Afghan refugee girls in Pakistan is outstanding and I truly admire what she has been able to achieve and the impact she has had on so many young lives. Every child should be in school with access to quality education so they can build a future for themselves, their families and communities,” said Ratwatte.<br />
“I had to stay home after I completed studies in grade 8 because there were no higher secondary schools in the entire camp,” said Saliha, one of the 11 Afghan refugee students enrolled in grade nine. Saliha who left school in 2010 said that with the upgrading of Aqeela Asifi’s school, many girls like herself will be able to chase their dreams of completing education and perusing career. I want to be a teacher and I know it is possible now,” she added. Ms. Asifi said “I feel elated to see the dreams of my students fulfilled. Education is power and when you have educated mothers, you have educated future generations,” she said.</p>
