    Press release<br />
Around the world COVID-19 is taking lives and changing communities but the virus is also inducing massive protection risks for women and girls forced to flee their homes, the Assistant High Commissioner for Protection at UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, Gillian Triggs, warned today.<br />
“We need to pay urgent attention to the protection of refugee, displaced and stateless women and girls at the time of this pandemic. They are among those most at-risk. Doors should not be left open for abusers and no help spared for women surviving abuse and violence,” said Triggs.<br />
Confinement policies, lockdowns and quarantines adopted across the world as a response to the pandemic have led to restricted movement, reduced community interaction, the closure of services and worsening socioeconomic conditions. These factors are significantly exacerbating the risks of intimate partner violence.<br />
“Some may end up confined to their shelters and homes, trapped with their abusers without the opportunity to distance themselves or to seek in-person support.”<br />
“Others, including those without documentation or those who have lost precarious livelihoods, as a result of the economic devastation that COVID-19 has inflicted, may be forced into survival sex or child marriages by their families. Within the household, many women are also taking on increased burdens as caregivers.”<br />
For survivors of violence and those at-risk, the consequences of COVID-19 also mean limited access to life-saving support, such as psychosocial, health and security services. Imposed mobility restrictions and containment measures make it difficult for women to access help while some services, including safe shelters, have been temporarily suspended, re-purposed or closed.<br />
“Globally, our network of UNHCR protection staff are on high alert. Our life-saving programmes for women and girls subjected to violence are being adapted where possible. In some locations they are now being managed remotely by social workers with the support of trained community volunteer networks,” said Triggs.<br />
Displaced women themselves remain involved at the forefront of the response, informing their communities about the risks of violence and providing information on prevention and protective health measures. They are also supporting survivors to access available, specialized support.<br />
UNHCR is also distributing emergency cash assistance to support survivors and women-at-risk. Action is also being coordinated across the humanitarian sector to ensure the risks of sexual and gender-based violence are mitigated throughout all sectoral interventions, including but not limited to the emergency health response.<br />
“To preserve lives and secure rights, Governments, together with humanitarian actors, must ensure that rising risks of violence for displaced and stateless women are taken into account in the design of national COVID-19 prevention, response and recovery plans,” said Triggs.<br />
This means ensuring critical services for survivors of gender-based violence are designated as essential and are accessible to those forcibly displaced. These include health and security services for survivors, psychosocial support services and safe shelters. Access to justice for survivors must also not be diminished.<br />
Given the deteriorating socioeconomic conditions now facing many refugee host countries, support from donors will be critically needed to preserve the operations of essential gender-based violence prevention and response services, including those provided by local, women-led organizations.<br />
“All women and girls have the right to a life free from all forms of violence. We must stand with displaced and stateless women and girls as we reiterate the <a href="https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwebtv.un.org%2Fwatch%2Fant%25C3%25B3nio-guterres-un-secretary-general-on-gender-based-violence-and-covid-19%2F6146979361001%2F%3Fterm%3D&data=02%7C01%7Cshahzad%40unhcr.org%7C6b37e15ed6e34d83393f08d7e5151240%7Ce5c37981666441348a0c6543d2af80be%7C0%7C0%7C637229750967055070&sdata=6UOzjrYquTA7oG7W6wHO86uQFEBHPZw1l1dilN8dBt4%3D&reserved=0">Secretary General’s message</a> and urge all governments to put all women and girls’ safety first as they respond to the pandemic.”<br />
