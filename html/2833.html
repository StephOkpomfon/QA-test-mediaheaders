<h2>What We Do</h2><p>UNHCR works to protect and assist refugees, internally displaced families, and stateless persons everywhere.</p></header>
    <br />
We strive to ensure that everyone has the right to seek asylum and find safe refuge in another State, with the option to eventually return home, integrate or resettle.<br />
During times of displacement, we provide critical emergency assistance in the form of clean water, sanitation and healthcare, as well as shelter, blankets, household goods and sometimes food. We also arrange transport and assistance packages for people who return home, and income-generating projects for those who resettle.<br />
Our help transforms broken lives.<br />
