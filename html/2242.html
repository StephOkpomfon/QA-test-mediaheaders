Responding to the Afghan refugee influx in 2001; providing assistance to the victims of the major earthquake in 2005; assisting the displaced during the SWAT and Bajaur IDP emergencies in 2008; assisting the authorities in responding to the 2009 IDP displacement from South Waziristan; helping those affected by the massive flood emergency in 2010; assisting those displaced during the Bara, Orakzai and Kurram IDP emergencies in 2011, as well as facilitating returns to FATA; supporting IDPs returning to Kurram and South Waziristan during 2012; responding to the Tirah valley IDP emergency during 2013; and now playing a key role in the government’s response to the June 2014 North Waziristan IDP displacement, Changaiz has proved himself to be a true humanitarian.<br />
His excellent communication skills and instinctive understanding of complex situations allow him to excel in promoting dialogue between the national authorities, the displaced, and other stakeholders, to ensure that they all understand IDP protection needs, as well as their underlying rights, and the obligations of the state and the international community.<br />
