<strong>UNHCR has zero tolerance policy against sexual exploitation and abuse.</strong><br />
What is sexual exploitation?<br />
<em>Any actual or attempted abuse of a position of vulnerability, differential power, or trust, for sexual purposes, including, but not limited to profiting monetarily, socially, or politically from the sexual exploitation of another.</em><br />
 <br />
What is sexual abuse?<br />
<em>The actual or threatened physical intrusion of a sexual nature, which can occur by force, under unequal conditions, or under coercive conditions.</em><br />
<em> </em><br />
As guided by the following six core principles on protection from sexual exploitation and abuse (PSEA), we, along with our partners, remain fully committed to protect our persons of concern from any form of SEA.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sexual exploitation and sexual abuse constitute acts of serious misconduct.</li>
<li>Mistaken belief in the age of a child is not a defense.</li>
<li>Exchange of money, employment, goods or services for sex, including sexual favours or other forms of humiliating, degrading or exploitative behaviour, is prohibited.</li>
<li>Sexual relationships between humanitarian workers and beneficiaries undermine the credibility and integrity of the humanitarian workers.</li>
<li>Suspicions must be reported via established reporting mechanism.</li>
<li>Having an environment that prevents sexual exploitation must be maintained.</li>
</ul>
<p> <br />
Any PSEA violations must be reported to <a href="mailto:phimapsea@unhcr.org">phimapsea@unhcr.org</a> or <a href="mailto:inspector@unhcr.org">inspector@unhcr.org</a>, because we care, we protect, we respond.<br />
