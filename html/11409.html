<strong>Six years since the start of the crisis, the needs of people displaced inside Syria continue to grow. Throughout it all, UNHCR has been present, delivering the vital support your donations make possible.</strong><br />
Together, we continue to help Syrian families in their hour of greatest need. Their resilience is inspiring. Despite serious risks to their own safety, our staff are out there every day, helping identify and assist those in most need. We couldn’t do it without the donations of caring people like you.<br />
<strong>Here are six ways you’ve helped struggling families in Syria this past year.</strong><br />
