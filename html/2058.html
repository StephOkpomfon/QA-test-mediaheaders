<p>Fazle Basir Basir and his family were displaced from Khyber Agency, a Pakistani tribal area bordering Afghanistan. Fazle Basir is a poet.

Basir has dreamed of a day when his poetry might be published. However, he lacks the resources to achieve this himself, but his last wish is to see his book published.</p>
