<p><strong>Who is UNHCR Philippines?</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Operating in the country for more than thirty years, UNHCR Philippines is the Philippine country office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), also known as the UN Refugee Agency. UNHCR was established in 1951 and is responsible for helping refugees, as well as internally displaced and stateless people, worldwide, including in the southern Philippines.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>UNHCR provides life-saving emergency assistance, including shelter and other core relief items, to families forced to flee their homes due to war or persecution, and when resources permits to those displaced by natural disasters. UNHCR also helps find durable solutions, whether it is helping families return home voluntarily and safely or helping them start a new life through local integration. We focus on humanitarian needs and rights of the most vulnerable, particularly women, children, the elderly, indigenous communities, and those living with disabilities.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why does UNHCR need to fundraise?</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Conflict, persecution, and natural disasters have forced millions of people from their homes over recent years. Currently, we are witnessing unprecedented levels of displacement and suffering – with more than <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/ph/26737-unhcr-ukraine-other-conflicts-push-forcibly-displaced-total-over-100-million-for-first-time.html">100 million persons</a> forcibly displaced worldwide.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>These include more than <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/ph/protection-cluster/mindanao-displacement-dashboards">158,725 internally displaced persons in the Philippines</a>, as of November 2022.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In several regions of the world, civilians suffered horrific violence and shocking human rights violations. The ability of humanitarians to provide relief increasingly fell short of the immense needs, highlighting the insufficiency of humanitarian funding in today’s complex global environment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>To learn more about our funding needs, you may download our Global Appeal for 2023 <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/the-global-appeal-and-supplementary-appeals.html?query=global%20appeal">here</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How will my money be used?</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>UNHCR is a humanitarian organization that relies on the trust, goodwill, and generosity of its stakeholders (the people of concern we protect and the actors with whom we partner with – including donors, implementing partners, host governments, and the public) to fulfil its mandate. By holding ourselves accountable, we demonstrate that we are worthy of this trust.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Around 85 percent of funding goes directly to humanitarian aid and programs, and just 15 percent goes to administrative expenses, including public awareness campaigns and fundraising. That means that for every PHP 100 you give, PHP 85 goes directly to benefit displaced families. UNHCR publishes updates and <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/publications/fundraising/6054ce134/2020-psp-donor-impact-report.html?query=donor%20impact%20report">impact reports</a>, both globally and in its Philippine <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/ph/newsletters">newsletter</a>, on funding collected and how donations have helped bring hope to displaced families.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why should I donate online? Is it safe?</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>UNHCR works tirelessly to uphold its aim to be good stewards of resources entrusted to us to benefit refugees and other displaced families. Donating online is convenient and secure. All information collected online is protected and treated with utmost confidentiality, and processing follows strict protocol on <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/ph/privacy-policy">data security</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Can I donate cash directly?</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>We encourage the public to give through credit card or bank deposit instead of straight cash donations to minimize fraud and other security risks. We encourage a certain minimum amount for one-off donations as banks charge us handling fees, which reduce the impact and benefit of smaller amounts for the refugees we serve.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why do I need to give monthly?</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Monthly gifts help UNHCR plan its budget to sustain programs, services, and strategies for the forcibly displaced families it serves. It also gives us the flexibility to be able to respond immediately when an emergency strikes and direct funding to where the need is greatest.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why don't you use volunteers to do fundraising and related admin work to save on operational cost?</strong></p>
<p>UNHCR is almost entirely funded by direct, voluntary contributions from member states. We also secure important contributions from the private sector, including individual donors.</p>
<p>That's why it is important to have professional, knowledgeable, and dedicated fundraising teams to help UNHCR raise vital funding for refugees in an increasingly competitive donor environment. Our committed staff members also produce detailed reports to ensure a high standard of transparency accountability, and stewardship of funds entrusted to UNHCR.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Does UNHCR have coin banks?</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>As of this time, we do not have the logistical capacity to handle coin banks. However, we do encourage pooled donations from among peers or interest groups. Groups may designate one focal point who will deposit the pooled amount in any of our bank accounts under account name UNHCR Philippines:</p>
