<h3>What is happening in Pakistan?</h3>




<p>Since mid-June, over 30 million people in Pakistan have been affected by unprecedented rains and devastating floods across the country, leaving 6.4 million people in urgent need of humanitarian assistance. Extreme and intense rainfall is expected to continue in September and October in Sindh province – the hardest-hit area – and threatens to exacerbate an already dire situation for at-risk populations who are among the most vulnerable to climate change.</p>

<h3>What is UNHCR doing to help?</h3>





<p>As part of UN-system wide efforts, UNHCR is supporting the government-led response to scale up humanitarian assistance for refugee and host communities affected by the monsoon rains. UNHCR – as the protection sector lead – is coordinating with other partners to mainstream protection, ensure gender sensitive approaches and promote refugee inclusion. UNHCR is also actively engaged in the inter-sectoral coordination of the <strong>shelter</strong>, <strong>WASH</strong>, <strong>education</strong>, <strong>health</strong>, <strong>food</strong> and <strong>nutrition</strong>, and <strong>livelihoods</strong> response.</p>






<p>While the main priority is to provide assistance to the worst flood-hit areas with relief items to address immediate needs, discussions are already underway to reprioritize activities for early recovery. In this regard, a Post-Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA) led by the Government of Pakistan with support from UNHCR, World Bank, Asian Development Bank and UNDP has been initiated to coordinate recovery and rehabilitation efforts among development partners.</p>
