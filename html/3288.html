UNHCR provided 11.5 million Pakistani rupees USD 110,000 for the improvement of the reproductive health-care unit at where about 40 percent of the patients are Afghan refugees.<br />
UNHCR’s partner agency, the Islamic Helping Hands organisation implemented the project, which included major renovation of the building and providing essential clinical equipment and furniture. The project is expected to benefit over 1,200 women and 2,000 children (under two years of age) each year by providing ante-natal, natal and post-natal health care services to both Pakistani and Afghan refugee communities.<br />
Minister Rahmat Saleh Baloch appreciated the work of UNHCR for undertaking this life-saving initiative and equipping a facility capable of providing mother and child healthcare service on 24/7 basis for the entire population of Qambrani.<br />
He expressed his gratitude to UNHCR for their continued support to the Government’s primary, secondary and tertiary health institutions where a significant number of Afghan patients are also receiving the services.<br />
Speaking at the occasion, Dinesh Shrestha, Head of UNHCR’s office in Quetta said: “that UNHCR is pleased to extend assistance to local communities who have shown tremendous generosity to Afghan refugees.”<br />
