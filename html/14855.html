“UNHCR is lending all possible support to Pakistan in this hour of need,’’ said Leyla Nugmanova, UNHCR Assistant Representative for Protection in Pakistan.<br />
“Based on our forty years of partnership and Pakistan’s extraordinary generosity for refugees, we cannot let the country and its people handle this colossal tragedy alone. The world has to understand what the people in Pakistan are going through and has to step in to help fast,” she added.<br />
