Monthly donations enrolled via credit card will be deducted or auto-debited on an ongoing basis per month. Single or one-off donations enrolled via credit card will be deducted on a one-time basis.<br />
<strong>Deduction Frequency</strong><br />
The first deduction will be made within 2 to 10 working days upon completion and submission of the donor form.<br />
Subsequently, credit cards will be charged once a month for monthly donors.<br />
Please refer to your credit card statement for confirmation of deductions made.<br />
