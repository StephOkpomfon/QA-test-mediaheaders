<p>The Ministry of States and Frontier Regions and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Pakistan wish to advise registered Afghan refugees in Pakistan that the Government of Pakistan has released an official Gazette notification recognising the validity of existing Proof of Registration (PoR) cards until 30 June 2013.<br />
Registered Afghan refugees are urged to keep their original PoR cards, issued by the National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA), with them at all times for identification purposes. With the continuing validity of the PoR cards, registered Afghan refugees living in Pakistan will have no action taken against them under the Foreigners Act.<br />
The PoR cards will not be replaced by new cards; however, under the new Government extension, existing POR cards remain valid until the end of June.<br />
The Government of Pakistan has also reaffirmed its commitment to the voluntary and dignified return of all Afghan refugees living in Pakistan.<br />
Registered Afghan refugees facing any difficulties regarding their status in Pakistan are encouraged to contact UNHCR on the hotline contact numbers indicated below.<br />
