<h3>What is happening in Ukraine?</h3>
<p>An escalation of the situation and military offensive in February 2022 has turned an already volatile situation into a full-scale emergency.Â  This is one of the largest human displacement crises in the world today. <strong>Within Ukraine, nearly 6 million people remain displaced by the war</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>ðŸ”µ For latest data, please visit our <a href="https://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations/ukraine">Data Portal</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, has been working in Ukraine since 1994</strong>, alongside local authorities, partners and community organizations to deliver protection and humanitarian assistance to people in need and remains on the ground to help now.</p>
<p>Â </p>
<h3>What is UNHCR doing to help?</h3>
<p><strong>We have stockpiles of aid, cash and other means to help people forced to fleeÂ </strong>and provided that humanitarian access and safety is granted, our staff are ready to deliver. More core relief items such as blankets, sleeping mats and emergency shelters are on their way and we are ready to provide cash assistance so that displaced people can purchase necessary items such as food and medicine. We are also scaling up our specialist protection services to identify people in need of particular assistance, such as children travelling alone and people with disabilities.</p>
<p>We have reinforced our operations in Ukraine and in neighbouring countries, sending more resources, staff and stockpiles. We are working with the authorities in countries that are welcoming refugees from Ukraine and stand ready to support reception facilities and reinforce additional capacity and supplies to find solutions for those forced to flee.</p>
<p>We remain firmly committed to protect and help all affected populations in Ukraine and countries in the region â€” but we need urgent support to scale up our response.</p>
