We are working closely with the Provincial Disaster Management Authority and we will do everything we can at this time to help and stand by the people of the province.”<br />
UNHCR has been part of the monsoon response since July when the agency started to provide relief items and assistance for refugees and host communities. In addition, UNHCR directly provided tents to the flood affected refugees and host communities through its partners.<br />

UNHCR is leading protection efforts as part of the UN’s support to the monsoon response. Relief items provided in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa includes sanitary kits for women and girls, and emergency reproductive and clinical delivery health kits. This will help provide important support for 420,000 women’s protection, health and dignity over three months.<br />
