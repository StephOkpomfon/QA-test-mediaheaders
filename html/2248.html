<p><strong>Razia Kakar, a Field Coordinator with the Afghan Refugee Education Project (AREP)</strong><br />
Struggling on many different fronts at the same time can be challenging, but passion leads to success in every sphere of life. For 34-year-old Razia Kakar, who is suffering from severe health problems, helping humanity is a noble cause.<br />

Born in a small village in Kuchlak near Quetta, Razia was the first woman in her family to acquire higher education. She works as a Field Coordinator with the Afghan Refugee Education Project (AREP) for the betterment of Afghan refugees in the Mohammad Khail, Refugee Village in Balochistan.<br />
Razia has to have dialysis three times a week as her kidneys have completely failed, but her hopes are still high.<br />
Despite the severity of her ailment, she regularly works visiting refugee villages with her colleagues.<br />
She remembers the day when she was diagnosed with chronic renal failure. “It was a huge setback, but I am determined to try to live a normal life and to do justice to my work helping refugees,” she said.<br />
