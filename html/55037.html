<strong>Description</strong><br />
Supply and delivery of various ICT equipment<br />
UNHCR may award Frame Agreement(s) with an initial duration of one (1) year, potentially extendable for a further period of two (2) one-year periods.<br />
Bidders can offer any of the items. All items will be evaluated and awarded separately.<br />
The estimated annual requirements of UNHCR, for years 2024, 2025 and 2026 are specified in Annex B.<br />
This solicitation exercise envisions having potentially several Frame Agreement holders, among whom a secondary bidding process would be implemented before awarding each purchase order. UNHCR will request quotations during the secondary bidding process. The award(s) will be based on the lowest price offered for each request for quotation, among the Frame Agreement holders. A minimum delivery lead time can be specified in the secondary bidding, and Purchase Orders may be awarded accordingly.<br />
UNHCR reserves the right to award multiple Purchase Orders simultaneously by distributing the requirements among the lowest quoted offers per item and/or most readily available items.<br />
Important Note: Prices offered against this current tender shall be maintained for 2 months after contract signature. The secondary bidding process will be activated following the expiry of the 2 months.<br />
The deadline for receipt of questions is on 08 October 2024 at 23:59 PST<br />
