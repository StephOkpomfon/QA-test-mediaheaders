“Since the outbreak of COVID-19 last year, until now, I have seen daily examples of women leading the way to deliver care in our communities. Women working as doctors and nurses, and also in other critical response services. Their bravery in the face of personal danger was and is inspiring. Women not only play important roles in our communities, they are real heroes,” she said.<br />
