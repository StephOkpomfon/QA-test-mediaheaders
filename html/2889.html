Addressing the audience, the UNHCR Assistant High Commissioner, Mr. George Okoth-Obbo appreciated the provincial Government’s efforts to provide refugee children with access to education through inclusion into Government schools, alongside their Pakistani peers, in line with the Government’s commitment to the SDG # 4 of ensuring inclusive and equitable education for all. He noted that investment in Pakistani and Afghan youth equals to investment in resilience, stability and future of both countries, and is as such a strategic priority of the Solutions Strategy for Afghan Refugees (SSAR) and the RAHA initiative, spearheaded by the Government of Pakistan. More than 280 RAHA projects, worth USD 32 million, have been implemented in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa since 2009, including an investment of USD 7.7 million in the provincial education sector. Mr. Okoth-Obbo thanked the Government of Germany for its consistent and generous support to RAHA education projects in Pakistan which exemplifies solidarity and responsibility-sharing of the international community with the people of Pakistan for hosting the world’s largest protracted refugee population.<br />

Upgrading of the existing education facilities is part of a joint One-UN, Refugee Affected and Hosting Areas (RAHA) programme led by the Government of Pakistan. Ten UN agencies, including UNHCR, and other partners are working with the government line departments to implement RAHA projects that improve access to basic services for Pakistani communities and Afghan refugees they are hosting. Since the launch of RAHA in 2009, some 3,500 RAHA projects have been implemented across Pakistan in the sectors of health, education, infrastructure, livelihoods, water and sanitation. More than 10.6 million people have benefited from RAHA projects, of which, overall around 11 per cent are Afghan refugees whilst 89 per cent have been Pakistani citizens in refugee hosting areas.</p>
