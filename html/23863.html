<p>Food is a universal language of kindness and community. It is an ever-warm expression of compassion, a bridge between generations, and an essential part of cultures. For World Refugee Day 2021, we’re serving you powerful stories of hope and inclusion through shared food and experiences—stories that will connect us across time and space.<br />
If you belong to a community that has welcomed refugees, or if you know people who have taken refuge in the Philippines, past and present, this is your chance to share stories of hope through food.<br />
Together, let us inspire and open others to the joy of acceptance and community as we share life stories at the table.<br />
