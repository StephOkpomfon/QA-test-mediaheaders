“We appreciate the Government decision to extend the PoR cards for twelve months, since this will provide predictability to Afghan refugees who were facing uncertainty and anxiety,” said UNHCR Country Representative in Pakistan, Ms. Ruvendrini Menikdiwela.<br />
Ms. Menikdiwela appreciated the people and government of Pakistan for generously hosting Afghan refugees for four decades.<br />
“Pakistan has been an exemplary host throughout” she said, adding that UNHCR will continue to support government policies which promote the resilience and voluntary repatriation in dignity and safety of the refugees.<br />
Ms. Menikdiwela said UNHCR will continue to call for international support to Pakistan for Pakistani host communities and Afghan refugees living in the country.<br />
Around 1.4 million registered Afghan refugees reside in Pakistan.<br />
