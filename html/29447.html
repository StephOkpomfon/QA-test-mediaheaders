<h2>2nd Refugee Film Festival Short Film Competition</h2></header>
    </p>
<p>Every year on 20th June, UNHCR, The UN Refugee Agency commemorates <strong>World Refugee Day</strong>, honoring the resilience and courage of millions of people who have been forced to flee war, persecution and violence. In 2023, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos, Jr. <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/ph/29983-statement-of-unhcr-philippines-on-presidential-proclamation-no-265-declaring-20-june-as-national-refugee-day.html">signed Proclamation No. 265 series of 2023</a>, declaring 20 June of every year as <strong>National Refugee Day</strong>. The proclamation enjoins all agencies and instrumentalities of the National Government, including government-owned or –controlled corporations, state universities and colleges, all local government units, non-government organizations, civil society groups, Philippines-based UN agencies, and the private sector “to actively participate and render the necessary support and assistance for the effective implementation” of the Proclamation. In particular, the observance of the National Refugee Day is deemed necessary <strong>to uphold and respect the rights of the refugees and stateless persons and promote awareness of their predicament.</strong></p>
<p>Building on the momentum from last year’s <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/ph/refugeefilmfestival">1<sup>st</sup> Refugee Film Festival</a>, UNHCR Philippines will be holding the <strong>2nd Refugee Film Festival</strong> in June 2024, showcasing the stories of people forced to flee through films and documentaries from the Philippines and around the globe.</p>
