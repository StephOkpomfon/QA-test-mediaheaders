UNHCR and NAMA, a Sharjah-based organization, will support semi-skilled refugee and Pakistani women artisans who will have an opportunity to polish their carpet-weaving skills and improve their income-generating capacity. The project is also supported by the IRTHI Contemporary Crafts Council, an affiliate of NAMA.<br />
The project – being implemented by UNHCR’s partner Taraqee Foundation – will benefit 100 Afghan refugee and Pakistani women. These women will not only be trained but also be given monthly stipends to support their family while they are working.<br />
The Head of UNHCR’s Sub-Office in Quetta, Mr. Zephania Amuiri, hailed the efforts of NAMA for helping to empower women with a view to showcasing their work at the international level.<br />
“Such projects are imperative to enable women to improve their technical skills and boost their self-reliance,” he said.<br />
On Afghan refugees, he added that the project will enhance the prospects of refugees for sustainable reintegration upon their voluntary return to Afghanistan.<br />
“When empowered and skilled, refugee returnees, especially women, will play a vital role in making their country prosperous and peaceful,” he said.</p>
