<strong>Izatullah Nizami’s journey from a refugee village in Balochistan to online influencer was paved with challenges. Now he is a business owner and a voice for his community.</strong><br />
"The difference in my life is incredible," declared 21-year-old Izatullah Nizami. "Before, I only slept three hours a night because of long hours of study and work. Now, life is beautiful. I am pursuing my passion, enjoying my work, taking care of my family as well as my wellbeing. Most of all, I am happy."<br />
Born and raised in the Saranan refugee village in Balochistan Province, Izatullah has become a voice for his community by producing and starring in his own lifestyle and educational videos, gaining a loyal following and earning an income from his social media channels. He is also a proud business owner, running a mobile repair shop and a fully equipped video studio.<br />
However, while Izatullah Nizami’s journey from a refugee village in Balochistan to online influencer was paved with challenges, he embodies resilience and determination.<br />
His grandfather fled from Kandahar, Afghanistan, to Pakistan over 40 years ago in search of safety. Since then, his family has worked hard to build a life. Izatullah's father and elder brothers worked on a day-to-day basis, securing just enough for the family to survive. From a young age, Izatullah also worked grueling days at a brick kiln to help pay for his schooling.</p>

<p>Izatullah’s life took a transformative turn when, while working as a manual labourer to support his education and family, an opportunity arose to pitch his business idea for a YouTube channel to the National Incubation Centre (NIC). After six months of intensive training, along with hands-on management training and marketing support, he was awarded a seed grant, providing much needed finance to help him get on the road to success.<br />
The NIC is a collaborative project between UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, and the Balochistan University of Information Technology, Engineering, and Management Sciences (BUITEMS) aimed at empowering Afghan refugees and host youth in Balochistan to become entrepreneurs through training and mentorship. Since 2022, UNHCR and BUITEMS have provided support to 200 Afghan refugees and local youth through the "My Identity, My Business" programme, which focuses on fostering entrepreneurship opportunities at the NIC.<br />

Izatullah's passion for video creation began when he was just a child, inspired by clips of actors, and setting in motion a life-long dream. For many around him, this was an impossible dream, owing to the high cost of equipment. Despite a lack of encouragement from friends and family, he persevered. In 2018, after completing his education, Izatullah used 15,000 rupees (approximately US $55) he earned as a daily worker, to buy his first smartphone and teach himself how to make videos and edit them.<br />
Since completing the NIC training, Izatullah's videos have garnered a significant following on social media. He now earns money from Facebook and YouTube and has the support of friends and local actors who appear in his videos. "We are poor financially, but we have good minds and important messages to share," he says, referencing his videos on the importance of education and continued learning. "When the quality of the video is good, people follow."<br />
Looking to the future, Izatullah aspires to making a movie and working in the entertainment industry. He also wishes to explore the world.<br />
His message to refugee youth is one of hope and perseverance: "Work for your community, work hard, keep learning and share your knowledge with the next generation."</p>
