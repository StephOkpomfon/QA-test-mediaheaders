The crisis in Marawi grabbed headlines in 2017, but other parts of Mindanao are affected by conflict and natural disasters. All across the southern Philippines, more than 104,000 are living in displacement and are in dire need of durable solutions.<br />
<strong>UNHCR's Assistance</strong><br />
UNHCR strives to assist and protect the internally displaced families by providing life-saving support and delivering durable solutions. This 2018, UNHCR Philippines worked to directly and indirectly restore hope to 12,198 families in Mindanao through quick-impact projects.<br />
Quick impact projects are low cost programs meant to respond to the basic priority needs expressed by the displaced families and the communities where they are being hosted. Projects are designed to address the needs of families such as accessing basic social services, providing livelihood assistance, and improving community empowerment and social impact.<br />
<strong>Protection cluster</strong><br />
UNHCR Philippines co-leads the the Protection Cluster in the Philippines. The cluster approach is a part of a global response aimed at providing more timely and consistent help to the internally displaced families. The cluster aims to assist the displaced population in their protection issues such as forced displacement, gaps in humanitarian support, lack of civil documentation among many others.<br />
