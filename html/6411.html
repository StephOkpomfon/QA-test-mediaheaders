    Press release<br />
ISLAMABAD, 2 March 2020: UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency has resumed its voluntary repatriation programme for registered Afghan refugees on Monday (today) after a three-month winter break.<br />
The voluntary repatriation operations had been suspended for the winter period from 1 December 2019 until 1 March 2020.<br />
UNHCR will facilitate repatriation from the voluntary repatriation centre at Azakhel, Nowshera in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. However, operations at the voluntary repatriation centre Baleli, Quetta will likely be resumed next week.<br />
The Proof of Registration card allows Afghan refugees the right to temporary legal stay in Pakistan.<br />
“As voluntary repatriation is a preferred solution for Afghan refugees, it must be voluntary, safe, dignified and well-informed,” said Mr. Iain Hall, UNHCR Deputy Representative in Pakistan.<br />
Mr. Hall acknowledged and appreciated the people and government of Pakistan for hosting Afghan refugees for more than four decades.<br />
UNHCR provides approximately USD200 to every registered individual upon their return to Afghanistan. Returnees receive the cash grant at UNHCR encashment centres in Afghanistan.<br />
Pakistan hosts more than 1.4 million registered Afghan refugees who are holding Proof of Registration (PoR) cards. Some 4.4 million Afghan refugees have returned to Afghanistan under the UNHCR-facilitated voluntary repatriation programme since 2002.<br />
End.</p>
