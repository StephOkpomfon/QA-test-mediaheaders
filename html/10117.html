<h2><em>More than 110 million people are forcibly displaced</em></h2>
<p>In last year's Global Trends report, UNHCR predicted that "the question is no longer if forced displacement will exceed 100 million people – but rather when". <strong>The when is now. </strong>With millions of Ukrainians displaced and further displacement elsewhere in 2022,<strong> total forced displacement now exceeds 100 million people</strong>. This means 1 in every 78 people on earth has been forced to flee – a dramatic milestone that few would have expected a decade ago.</p>
<p>As new refugee situations emerge and intensify, and as existing ones reignite or remain unresolved, there is an acute need for durable solutions at increasing scale. The <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/the-global-compact-on-refugees.html">Global Compact on Refugees</a> notes that one strategic priority for UNHCR and the humanitarian community is to identify and support durable solutions that enable refugees to rebuild their lives and live in safety and dignity.</p>
<p><strong>Mindanao Displacement</strong></p>
<p>As of November 2022, an estimated total number of <strong>32,216</strong> families (<strong>158,725</strong> individuals) were displaced in Mindanao due to crime & violence (<strong>8,459</strong> individuals), armed conflict (<strong>3,245</strong> individuals), natural disaster (<strong>85,810</strong> individuals), and clan feud (<strong>61,211</strong> individuals).</p>

<p><strong>How we gather our data</strong></p>
<p>Full-time statisticians in UNHCR's Field Information and Coordination Section track the number of people forced to flee so that when a major displacement crisis erupts, we are able to predict <strong>how many people need help</strong>, <strong>how much help they need</strong> and <strong>how many staff we must deploy</strong>.</p>
<p>These figures are released every year in our <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/globaltrends">Global Trends</a> and <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/the-global-appeal-and-supplementary-appeals.html">Global Appeal</a> reports.</p>

<p><strong>Staff figures</strong></p>
<p>Our workforce is the backbone of UNHCR. As of 31 December 2021, we employ 18,879 people, of whom around nearly 91 per cent are based in the field.</p>
<p>We work in 134 countries and territories, with personnel based in a mixture of regional and branch offices and sub and field offices. Our teams work hard to help the displaced, specializing in a wide range of disciplines, including legal protection, administration, community services, public affairs and health.</p>
