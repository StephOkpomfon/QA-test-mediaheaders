The keynote speaker, Ms. Raheela Durrani, Speaker of Balochistan Assembly, said: “Education and youth empowerment serve as the perfect impetus to energise the young people. We need to excite young minds, let’s make our youth empowered with education and skills.”<br />
Recognising the important roles of youth in nation building, she said: “Youth need a voice and a platform to share their opinions and experiences, and thanked UNCHR for organizing this event.” She further stressed: “Youth is not just a word but a power in itself, and therefore they should be committed with a cause in this competitive world.”<br />
A brief presentation was given by the UNHCR office explaining the participants its youth related activities in Balochistan. Under UNHCR programmes youth groups in the refugee villages have been fully engaged in multi-sectorial community committees to strengthen the coordination mechanism and to build capacities that will further lead to active participation in decision making.<br />
Head of UNHCR’s office in Quetta, Dinesh Shrestha said<strong>:</strong> “Youth play an important role in bringing peace and sustainable development in the region. This will only be possible if they are given opportunities and the right environment, enabled with skills and knowledge, guided with values to work together beyond the narrow confines of national borders. This seminar is a first step towards achieving those goals where both Pakistani and Afghan youths can come together to discuss their common interests and opinions, and prepare to become the agents of change in the society.”<br />
