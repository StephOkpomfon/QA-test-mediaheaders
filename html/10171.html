<strong>The world is witnessing unprecedented numbers of people forced to flee their homes. Driven by the Syria crisis and conflicts in South Sudan, Central African Republic, Burundi and Central America, they are rising every day.</strong><br />
To escape the violence they leave behind everything.<br />
Now, a shelter crisis is unfolding, with millions of families arriving in refugee camps or struggling in sub-standard housing and half-built shelters. We believe all refugees deserve to live in safe shelter.<em><strong> </strong></em><br />

<em><strong>Nobody Left Outside</strong></em> is a global campaign to raise funds to shelter two million people who have been forced to flee their homes.<br />
Only UNHCR has the reach and expertise to tackle this crisis at scale – but we can’t do this alone.<br />
Be a part of the solution and help make sure there is Nobody Left Outside.<br />
