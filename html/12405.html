<p><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong><br />
The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees was established on 14 December 1950 by the United Nations General Assembly. The agency is mandated to lead and co-ordinate international action to protect refugees and resolve refugee problems worldwide. Its primary purpose is to safeguard the rights and well-being of refugees. It also has a mandate to help stateless people.<br />
In more than six decades, the agency has helped tens of millions of people restart their lives. Today, a staff of some 9000 people in 126 countries continues to help about 60 million persons. To help and protect some of the world’s most vulnerable people in so many places and types of environment, UNHCR must purchase goods and services worldwide. For further information on UNHCR, its mandate and operations, please see <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/ph/">www.unhcr.org/ph</a>.<br />
