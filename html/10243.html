<strong>The Protection Cluster in the Philippines has been established by the National Disaster Coordinating Council (NDCC) Circular No 5 series of 10 May 2007 (Institutionalizing Cluster Approach in Philippine Disaster System). The cluster approach is part of a global response aimed at providing more timely and consistent help to the internally displaced and other affected people in complex emergencies and disasters.</strong><br />
The Protection Cluster in Mindanao meets in Cotabato, Iligan, Davao and other cities on a regular basis. Currently there are over 100 participating agencies including from the Government, State, Civil Society, national and international NGOs and agencies, as well as the United Nations.<br />

<h3>Key Protection Issues and Challenges</h3>
<p><strong>Forced displacement:</strong> It is estimated that as of the end of 2017, more than 419,200 persons were displaced in Mindanao. Displacement is caused by a number of reasons and agents. It is recurrent, often takes place in remote areas, and can often have strong political implications (especially family/clan feuds).<br />
<strong>Lack of information:</strong> The lack of evidence based data across the island has made a large number of at-risk and displaced communities ‘invisible’.<br />
<strong>Gaps in humanitarian support:</strong> There is a limited presence of protection agencies/activities outside of GPH-MILF Conflict Affected Areas. There is difficulty in accessing State services, including social welfare programmes, especially in fragile remote communities.<br />
<strong>Lack of civil documentation:</strong> 5-10 million people in Mindanao do not have birth certificates. They are at risk of becoming stateless over generations and they cannot access basic services even if displaced.<br />
<strong>Children:</strong> Abuse, exploitation, and trafficking exists. Grave Child Rights Violations in situations of armed conflict, including recruitment and use of children and attacks on schools and hospitals, have also occurred.<br />
<strong>Land, property and housing issues:</strong> Issues related to land ownership and control over the use of resources are common; Family feuds (<em>ridos</em>) are often based on land issues.<br />
