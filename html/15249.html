<h2 style="text-align: left"><b>Background</b></h2>
<p>What were you doing 11 years ago?</p>
<p>In March 2011 in Syria, many people were hurriedly packing their bags, to escape a brutal conflict that would become the biggest humanitarian and refugee crisis of our time.</p>
<p>Eleven years on into the emergency, some 6.9 million Syrians are still displaced in their own country. About 14.6 million people need humanitarian and protection assistance – more than in 2021 (about 9% more). Through it all – thanks to your support – UNHCR has been on the ground to help those forced to flee, while calling on all parties to find a peaceful resolution.</p>

<h2><b>The People of Syria</b></h2>

<p>Syria accounts for the world’s largest number of forcibly displaced people with over half of its population forced to flee.</p>
<p>Syrian families everywhere continue to demonstrate their courage and resilience, making huge sacrifices to put their children’s needs first, turning their temporary shelters into homes, showing their entrepreneurial spirit and their deep desire to rebuild their lives with hope and dignity.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><b>Why is your help needed?</b></h2>
<p>Since the start of the Syrian conflict in March 2011, over half of the country’s population has been forced to flee their homes. Most seek refuge elsewhere in the country, if they can.</p>
<p>Eleven years into the crisis, UNHCR teams are still on the ground day in and day out, helping to identify and assist those most in need. We are the primary UN agency leading on protection and community services, shelter and the distribution of essential relief items inside Syria.</p>
<p><strong>We couldn’t do it without the donations of caring people like you.</strong></p>
