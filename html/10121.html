<blockquote>
<h2><strong>Protecting all people forced to flee and those denied a nationality</strong></h2>
</blockquote>
<p>Seeking asylum is a human right. Anyone fleeing persecution, conflict, or human rights abuses has a right to seek protection in another country.</p>
<p><b>UNHCR works to ensure that this right is upheld.</b></p>
<p>We provide life-saving support and safeguard the rights of asylum-seekers, refugees and people displaced within their own country due to conflict or persecution. We also work to protect, support and advocate for people denied a nationality and refugees who have chosen to return to their own country.</p>
<p>With 89.3 million people forcibly displaced from their homes globally, there are more people under our protection today than at any point since the Second World War.Â </p>
