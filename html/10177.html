<strong>iBelong is a 10-year global campaign that aims to end the devastating legal limbo of statelessness, which affects millions of people around the world and makes their lives difficult.</strong><br />
Today 10 million people around the world are denied a nationality. They often aren’t allowed to go to school, see a doctor, get a job, open a bank account, buy a house or even get married. You can help change their lives.<br />

<p style="padding-left: 30px">#IBELONG to a world where everyone has the right to a nationality.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Across the world today more than ten million people are told they don’t belong ANYWHERE. They are called ‘stateless’. They are denied a nationality. And with it, they are denied their basic rights. Statelessness can mean a life without education, without medical care, or legal employment. It can mean a life without the ability to move freely, without prospects, or hope. Statelessness is inhumane. The main reason people are stateless is because of discrimination. Because of their ethnicity.<br />
Because of their religion. Because in some countries women cannot pass their nationality on to their children. We believe it’s time to end this injustice. With enough courage we know it is possible. Governments can change their laws and procedures, and give stateless people their rights and a place to belong. Within ten years, we can ensure everyone has a nationality. Because if we don’t this injustice will only get worse.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">A child is born stateless every ten minutes. By the time you finish reading this letter another person may have started life without a nationality. We are ready to make our voices heard. We believe that if we take a stand, others will join us. And if enough of us stand up we will end this inhumanity. That is why UNHCR has launched the Campaign to End Statelessness in 10 years. Sixty years ago, the world agreed to protect stateless people. Now it’s time to end statelessness itself.</p>
