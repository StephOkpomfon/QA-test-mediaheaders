Each day war forces thousands of families to flee their homes.<br />
People like you, people like me.<br />
To escape the violence, they leave everything behind – everything except their hopes and dreams for a safer future. UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency believes all refugees deserve to live in safety.<br />
Add your name to the #WithRefugees petition to send a clear message to decision makers that they must act with solidarity and shared responsibility.<br />
<strong>The petition asks decision makers to:</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">-Ensure every refugee child gets an education.<br />
-Ensure every refugee family has somewhere safe to live.<br />
-Ensure every refugee can work or learn new skills to support their families.</p>
<p>The campaign continues until a global compact for refugees is adopted in 2018.<br />
<strong>We stand together #WithRefugees.</strong><br />
<strong> Please stand with us.</strong><br />
