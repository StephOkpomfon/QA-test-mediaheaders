<strong>We work to ensure that everybody has the right to seek asylum and find safe refuge, having fled violence, persecution, war, or armed conflict.</strong><br />
In 2011, the Republic of the Philippines marked its 30th year as signatory to the 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol. UNHCR continues to work with the Government of the Philippines and other stakeholders in upholding a favourable protection environment for refugees and asylum seekers, not only within the Philippine context but also in Asia.<br />
