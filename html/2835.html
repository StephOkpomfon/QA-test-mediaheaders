<h2>Where We Work</h2><p>UNHCR is often the first in and the last out in an emergency situation, supporting those forced to flee their homes through no fault of their own. </p></header>
    <br />
UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, is a global organisation dedicated to saving lives, protecting rights and building a better future for refugees, forcibly displaced communities and stateless people. Present in 134 countries worldwide, we provide vital assistance to millions forced from home – all thanks to your support.<br />
UNHCR is often the first in and the last out in an emergency situation, supporting those forced to flee their homes through no fault of their own. Long after emergencies have left the headlines, UNHCR remains on the ground to help revive devastated communities and help displaced families return, recover and restart their lives. UNHCR is with refugees at every stage of their journey – whenever and wherever needed.<br />
During emergencies, UNHCR’s network of warehouses and stockpiles enable us to quickly and effectively respond, providing people forced to flee with the assistance and protection they need.Thanks to these global stockpiles, we can deploy aid – including blankets, tents, and mosquito nets – for at least 600,000 people within the first 72 hours of an emergency.<br />
UNHCR also has arrangements in place to rapidly deploy emergency staff, when our teams on the ground need extra support.<br />
