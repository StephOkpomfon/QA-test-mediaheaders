During the meeting, various collaboration initiatives were discussed including; UNHCR support to upgrade equipment in health facilities, designing joint programmes to address health, nutrition, safe water and hygiene, etc for refugees and the host communities, and training of Afghan refugee men and women as paramedics at relevant training institutes in Islamabad.
