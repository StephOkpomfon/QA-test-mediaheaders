UNHCR has been rushing in additional aid to Bangladesh where the early rains have begun. The monsoon season is expected to bring floods and landslides in the areas where hundreds of thousands of Rohingya are trying in Cox’s Bazar district – one of the wettest areas of the country. Humanitarian partners estimate that around 200,000 Rohingya refugees will be at risk this monsoon season. They are living on land prone to landslides and flooding and are in urgent need of relocation. Of this number, 24,000 people are at critical risk due to severe instability of the land on which their shelters have been constructed.<br />
UNHCR is equipping refugee families with upgraded shelter kits, which will include bamboo poles, ropes, shelter-grade tarpaulins, sandbags, and tools. In addition, UNHCR is distributing 80,000 pre-monsoon kits to help secure shelters in case of storms, and is stock-piling 160,000 post-disaster response kits to be distributed to refugees, as well as another 30,000 post-disaster response kits to be distributed to any families who might be affected among the host community. UNHCR has already positioned five hospital tents and emergency health kits in Cox’s Bazar. More medicines and supplies are being ordered.To learn get more information about UNHCR's operational update, please click<a href="http://reporting.unhcr.org/sites/default/files/UNHCR%20Bangladesh%20Operational%20Update%20-%2021APR-8MAY18.pdf"> here.</a>  You can also learn more about the Rohingya crisis <a href="https://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations/myanmar_refugees">here</a>.</p>
