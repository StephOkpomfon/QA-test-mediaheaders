The decision to extend the validity of the Proof of Registration cards to some 1.3 million registered Afghans refugees until the end of 2017; a pledge to document Afghan nationals who currently have no identification; a commitment to adopt a national refugee law; and a visa regime for different categories of Afghan nationals was approved at a Cabinet meeting Tuesday.<br />
UNHCR Representative in Pakistan, Indrika Ratwatte said: “Today’s announcement is a step change for Afghan refugees and those Afghans without documentation living in Pakistan. The introduction of a visa regime has a potentially transformative impact on people’s daily lives.”<br />
UNHCR appreciates the Government of Pakistan’s support to Afghan refugees for nearly four decades. UNHCR will continue to seek robust international support for voluntary repatriation and more equitable responsibility-sharing to fully support Afghan refugees and host communities in Pakistan.<br />
