<h2>World Refugee Day 2024</h2></header>
    </p>
<p>Each year on 20 June, the world celebrates World Refugee Day, the international day to honour people who have been forced to flee.</p>
<p>Together, we can champion their right to seek safety, build support for their economic and social inclusion, and advocate for solutions to their plight.</p>
<p>We look forward to seeing you all in person as we commemorate this important day. Below are some activities we have prepared for you. <strong>See you soon!</strong></p>
